Certification as an SLRP Coach last three years and requires a deep understanding of the Student-Led Restorative Practices framework, the ability to demonstrate that understanding in practice, and the ability to support district- and school-based restorative practices teams through its implementation. These competencies are revealed through demonstrations of learning regarding:
<ul>
<li>Restorative Knowledge (GK 1-12)</li>
<li>Restorative Skill (GS 1-9)</li>
<li>Restorative Mindset (GM 1-3)</li>
<li>Coaching Knowledge (CK 1-7)</li>
<li>Coaching Skill (CS 1-6)</li>
<li>Coaching Mindset (CM 1-6)</li>
</ul><br/>

Unless there is a demonstration of learning (DoL) defined in the competency, each competency type relies on a default DoL. The default DoL for knowledge competencies is a one page writing. The default DoL for skills competencies is a written or video artifact. The default DoL for mindset competencies is coach observation with rubric. Alternative DoLs can be determined by a Senior Coach.
